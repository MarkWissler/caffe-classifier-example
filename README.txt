This is a sister resource for a [blog post](http://www.exaptive.com/blog/how-i-made-a-neural-network-web-application-in-an-hour) about using caffe within the [Exaptive](http://www.exaptive.com/) platform to do image recognition. In it, I have stripped out all the Exaptive-specific code (such as handling inEvents) to make it a bit more understandable.

You'll also note that I've split the nameMap out into a separate file to prevent clutter in the main script.

Special thanks to [Waylon Flinn](https://twitter.com/waylonflinn) for his support and tutelage on a project that introduced me to caffe.
